                Cumberbatch is well-known for his role in Sherlock playing the
                titular character, solving crimes in modern-day London.
                Cumberbatch has played his fair share of odd, quirky characters
                and Sherlock is no exception. Benedict plays Sherlock Holmes
                well, portraying the character's intelligence and tendency to be
                cold appropriately. Sherlock is something of a reluctant
                celebrity thanks to Watson's blog on him, but fans wouldn't have
                it any other way

                Benedict Cumberbatch has earned two Oscar nominations and his
                most recent one came for the Netflix movie The Power of the Dog.
                The movie was a western where Cumberbatch played a wealthy ranch
                owner named Phil Burbank. He was a bad man, someone who bullied
                a local widowed woman named Rose Gordon, played by Kirsten
                Dunst, while also dealing with his own brother Geroge and Rose's
                son Peter. The movie picked up an impressive 12 Oscar
                nominations, but it only won for Best Director

                When audiences first met Doctor Strange, he was a renowned
                doctor that had an inflated ego and certainly didn't treat those
                around him kindly. All of this changes when a car accident ruins
                his hands, thus ending his career. Strange sends himself into
                debt while searching for a cure, and comes to find the Mystic
                Arts, learning to open up his mind, save the world, and become a
                better person in the process. He also later foresees the end of
                Avengers: Endgame, knowing all along that it would take a final
                sacrifice from Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) to take out Thanos
                once and for all
